print('Once upon a time, in the deserts of Arizona, there lived a small boll weevil who was troubled with strange dreams.')
print('Every night he awoke upon his barrel cactus, staring at the moon, wondering what the faces in his dream had meant.') 
print('Who was trying to communicate with him? And what exactly had they said to him?')
print('He couldn't remember. All he knew was that he was alone in the desert, and someone was watching him.')
